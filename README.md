This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to unexpected behavior when an empty array is returned from a function. The issue arises when the calling function doesn't handle empty array returns appropriately, leading to unexpected results or errors. The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a solution demonstrating how to correctly handle this scenario.
